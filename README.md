## Setup Guide
### Installation
#### Prerequisites
1. Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm install` in the root directory to install the required node modules.

### Launch Application
1. Run `npm start` to launch the application at `localhost:3000`.

### Build Application
1. Run `npm run build` to create a build of the app in a `build` folder.
2. The build can be served locally by running `serve -s build`. This will serve the build at `localhost:5000`.

## Technology
This project uses:
- HTML
- SCSS
- JS
- React.js
- Node.js

Create React App was used as the base of this project:
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

&nbsp;
## Configurables
There are a number of configurable properties which can be set throughout the project:

### api.js
Property | Purpose
---------|---------
`API_KEY` | My personal API Key from NewsAPI. Get yours here: https://newsapi.org/
`resultsToDisplay` | Number of results to get from the News API
`articleCharacterLimit` | Maximum number of characters to be displayed in each article's content
`articleContentDelimiter` | String to display to indicate the end of the displayed article's content

### _variables.scss
These are global SCSS properties which are used throughout the project.

## Improvements
### Application
- Allow further filtering of searches. NewsAPI offers a range of parameters which can further filter user's searches (see https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything). Filtering options could be added to the `NewsSearch` component.
- Simple message to the user should their search provide no results.

### Technology
- TypeScript could be used in place of JavaScript. This brings a number of technical benefits ranging from:
    - Static types
    - Enhanced IDE support
    - Strict null checks

- Replace Fetch API with Axios:
    - Fetch API is less backwards-compatible than Axios. Notably it's not comptaible with IE11 (see https://caniuse.com/?search=Fetch)
- Obfuscate API Key
    - While it's less of an issue for a small project of this scale, In a real-life enterprise project the API Key should be visible in plain-text in a client-side file.
